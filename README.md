## Hi, I'm Myian.

I'm sometimes a streamer over on [twitch.tv/myian](https://twitch.tv/myian). These days, I'm more of a writer. I'll always be a person.

For my own purposes, I created [tcpi.ahk](https://github.com/HeyMyian/tcpi) with AutoHotkey. It's a script that lets Twitch viewers interact with your broadcasting software, your input devices, play sounds or do text-to-speech. I also wrote a [Random Syllable to Fantasy Word Generator](https://words.myian.tv) with PHP because I really needed one. It's not yet on GitHub.

Of course there are 999 projects, and, oh, hey, what's that over there?

*A new idea.*
